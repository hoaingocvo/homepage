        <h3>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>

        <div> I like the idea of handmade refers to human contribution in coding rather than machine. This is because when thinking of a web, majority of us has a misconception that it's all high-technology - which means machine heavy and less humanish. Just like how hand drawing is different from digital drawing which involves more technologies. The fact that 'web' and 'hand' is still working together remind people of how all technology begins with human. Which is an important and valuable part that in this date and age most people tends to forget. Just like the incident of AI technology is replacing and threatening to out-talented artists in this new era.</div>

        <div>One of my favourite quote from the reading is this: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." This is so true especially in our age where there's thousands of application that help us made a website. Although premate website template is fast and convinient, it is unreliable. Thereford it's still essential to learn the basic principle to able to stand on our owns incase the main sever / company shut down.</div>

        <div>I also find the part of how a viewer can Right-click and view page sources, and the comparison of how the readers become the writers. It makes me curious what is the copyright law for websites? And apple devices like Ipad take away the option was it because a scared of technologies leak? Is it possible for us to also take away that option for our Hand-made website.
