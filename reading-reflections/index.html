        <h3>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>

        <p> I like the idea of handmade refers to human contribution in coding rather than machine. This is because when thinking of a web, majority of us has a misconception that it's all high-technology - which means machine heavy and less humanish. Just like how hand drawing is different from digital drawing which involves more technologies. The fact that 'web' and 'hand' is still working together remind people of how all technology begins with human. Which is an important and valuable part that in this date and age most people tends to forget. Just like the incident of AI technology is replacing and threatening to out-talented artists in this new era.</p>
