        <h1>Hoai's Reading Reflections</h1>
        <h3>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>

        <div>I like the idea of handmade refers to human contribution in coding rather than machine. This is because when thinking of a web, majority of us has a misconception that it's all high-technology - which means machine heavy and less humanish. Just like how hand drawing is different from digital drawing which involves more technologies. The fact that 'web' and 'hand' is still working together remind people of how all technology begins with human. Which is an important and valuable part that in this date and age most people tends to forget. Just like the incident of AI technology is replacing and threatening to out-talented artists in this new era.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">One of my favourite quote from the reading is this: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." This is so true especially in our age where there's thousands of application that help us made a website. Although premate website template is fast and convinient, it is unreliable. Thereford it's still essential to learn the basic principle to able to stand on our owns incase the main sever / company shut down.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">I also find the part of how a viewer can Right-click and view page sources, and the comparison of how the readers become the writers. It makes me curious what is the copyright law for websites? And apple devices like Ipad take away the option was it because a scared of technologies leak? Is it possible for us to also take away that option for our Hand-made website.</div>   
        
        <h3>Week 4: Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</h3>

        <div>"The first computers were human (p.5)". This quote is really what gets me thinking. Whenever I heard the term computer, my mind directly go to 'machine'. And human v.s machine has always been potraited as opposite forces of power. Especially in this day and age where more and more people lost their jobs to machine. The idea of these two term linked is not something i would expected outside of the setting of this class.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">When they started talking about how computer operates on 1 - 0 binary system, things srated to become more interesting. This information brought me back to my childhood memory when I was in fifth grade learning about coding for the first time. The reading also call out how the world we live in is not binary, but vary in different values. This reminds me of the comparation I made in the beginning about how humand and computer are not in the same realm. Human are more complex and can't be reduce to binary. Emotions are not black and white, but there's gray and dull too.</div>   

        <div class="smallspace">When the author compare the computer and art, it is actually interesting but make me agree. When you look at a painting, you need to give it time and slowly pulling it layers to be able to understand it. Computers might be confusing at first, but once we look into it deep enought and slowly study it like a painting, we might able to see through it.</div> 
        
        <h3>Week 5: Callum Copley, A Friend is Writing!</h3>

        <div>"New platforms are altering the temporal and spatial nature of conversation, and in turn affecting the ways we interact. The text of an instant message appears as a two dimensional object on a screen, yet its meaning is not static (p.18)." Has anyone has a similar experience where they socialized with people better online than actually in person? Also able to find more friends online? As someone who is very quited in the classroom as well as struggling to adapt to small talking in social settings, I sense a massive different in who I am online and in person. In social environments, I easily get close to someone and become group leader in different clans. Mostly the reason is internet creates a pathway for me to meet people shared my interests easier, where my talents or charms actually vibes better. </div>

        <div class="smallspace">But this go hand-in hand with another struggle I faced on online environments. I became more emotional and attached to online arguments. I became more hooked in things that i wouldn't take serious or affect my mentality as much if it was in real life. For example, seeing a closed friend online liked or commented to a picture of someone I dislike. Or knowing someone unfriended or blocked me when we have no beef before. We may know each other online but not actually know who they are of a person in real life. It is very different. I wouldn't able to see who my friends hanging out with beside me in real life. The time we spend with each other is the only thing that matter and more serious.</div>   

        <div class="smallspace">It's also another problem of quality and quantity. I might able to meet more people online, talks or contacts with them more often. But at the end of the day, those are not real physical experience. It was just me and the screen the whole time. You might have a bunch of instagram followers or facebook friends, but non of those you actually able to share personal story or have deep conversation. However, we sometimes focused our attention and energy more onto these online relasionships and neglecting the real one that we are having outside.</div>
