        <h1>Hoai's Reading Reflections</h1>
        <h3>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>

        <div>I like the idea of handmade refers to human contribution in coding rather than machine. This is because when thinking of a web, majority of us has a misconception that it's all high-technology - which means machine heavy and less humanish. Just like how hand drawing is different from digital drawing which involves more technologies. The fact that 'web' and 'hand' is still working together remind people of how all technology begins with human. Which is an important and valuable part that in this date and age most people tends to forget. Just like the incident of AI technology is replacing and threatening to out-talented artists in this new era.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">One of my favourite quote from the reading is this: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." This is so true especially in our age where there's thousands of application that help us made a website. Although premate website template is fast and convinient, it is unreliable. Thereford it's still essential to learn the basic principle to able to stand on our owns incase the main sever / company shut down.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">I also find the part of how a viewer can Right-click and view page sources, and the comparison of how the readers become the writers. It makes me curious what is the copyright law for websites? And apple devices like Ipad take away the option was it because a scared of technologies leak? Is it possible for us to also take away that option for our Hand-made website.</div>   
        
        <h3>Week 4: Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</h3>

        <div>"The first computers were human (p.5)". This quote is really what gets me thinking. Whenever I heard the term computer, my mind directly go to 'machine'. And human v.s machine has always bene potraited as opposite force of power. Especially in this day and age where more and more people lost their jobs to machine. The idea of these two term linked is not something i would expected outside of the setting of this class.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">When they started talking about how computer operates on 1 - 0 binary system, things srated to become more interesting. This information brought me back to my childhood memory when I was in fifth grade learning about coding for the first time. The reading also call out how the world we live in is not binary, but vary in different values. This reminds me of the comparation I made in the beginning about how humand and computer are not in the same realm. Human are more complex and can't be reduce to binary. Emotions are not black and white, but there's gray and dull too.</div>   

        <div class="smallspace">When the author compare the computer and art, it is actually interesting but make me agree. When you look at a painting, you need to give it time and slowly pulling it layers to be able to understand it. Computers might be confusing at first, but one we look into it deep enought and slowly study it like a painting, we might able to see through it.</div>
