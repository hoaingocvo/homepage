        <h1>Hoai's Reading Reflections</h1>
        <h3>Week 2: J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h3>

        <div>I like the idea of handmade refers to human contribution in coding rather than machine. This is because when thinking of the web, the majority of us have a misconception that it's all high-technology - which means machine-heavy and less humanist. Just like how hand drawing is different from digital drawing which involves more technologies. The fact that 'web' and 'hand' are still working together reminds people of how all technology begins with humans. This is an important and valuable part that in this day and age most people tend to forget. Just like the incident of AI technology replacing and threatening to out-talented artists in this new era.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">One of my favorite quotes from the reading is this: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity." This is so true, especially in our age where there are thousands of applications that help us make a website. Although the premade website template is fast and convenient, it is unreliable. Therefore it's still essential to learn the basic principles to be able to stand on our own in case the main sever / company shuts down.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">I also find the part about how a viewer can Right-click and view page sources, and the comparison of how the readers become the writers. It makes me curious what is the copyright law for websites? And Apple devices like iPads take away the option was it because of a scare of technology leaks? Is it possible for us to also take away that option for our Hand-made website?</div>   
        
        <h3>Week 4: Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</h3>

        <div>"The first computers were human (p.5)". This quote is really what gets me thinking. Whenever I hear the term computer, my mind directly goes to 'machine'. And human v. machines have always been portrayed as opposite forces of power. Especially in this day and age where more and more people lost their jobs to machines. The idea of these two-term links is not something I would expected outside of the setting of this class.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">When they started talking about how a computer operates on a 1 - 0 binary system, things started to become more interesting. This information brought me back to my childhood memory when I was in fifth grade learning about coding for the first time. The reading also calls out how the world we live in is not binary but varies in different values. This reminds me of the comparison I made in the beginning about how humans and computers are not in the same realm. Humans are more complex and can't be reduced to binary. Emotions are not black and white, but there's gray and dull too.</div>   

        <div class="smallspace">When the author compares the computer and art, it is actually interesting but makes me agree. When you look at a painting, you need to give it time and slowly pull its layers to be able to understand it. Computers might be confusing at first, but once we look into it deep enough and slowly study it like a painting, we might able to see through it.</div> 
        
        <h3>Week 5: Callum Copley, A Friend is Writing!</h3>

        <div>"New platforms are altering the temporal and spatial nature of conversation, and in turn affecting the ways we interact. The text of an instant message appears as a two dimensional object on a screen, yet its meaning is not static (p.18)." Has anyone had a similar experience where they socialized with people better online than actually in person? Also able to find more friends online? As someone who is very quiet in the classroom as well as struggling to adapt to small talking in social settings, I sense a massive difference in who I am online and in person. In social environments, I easily get close to someone and become a group leader in different clans. Mostly the reason is internet creates a pathway for me to meet people who share my interests more easily, where my talents or charms actually vibe better.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">But this goes hand-in-hand with another struggle I faced in online environments. I became more emotional and attached to online arguments. I became more hooked on things that I wouldn't take seriously or affect my mentality as much if they were in real life. For example, seeing a close friend online liked or commented on a picture of someone I dislike. Or knowing someone unfriended or blocked me when we had no beef before. We may know each other online but not actually know who they are a person in real life. It is very different. I wouldn't be able to see who my friends hanging out with beside me in real life. The time we spend with each other is the only thing that matters and is more serious.</div>   

        <div class="smallspace">It's also another problem of quality and quantity. I might be able to meet more people online, and talk or contact them more often. But at the end of the day, those are not real physical experiences. It was just me and the screen the whole time. You might have a bunch of Instagram followers or Facebook friends, but none of those you are actually able to share personal stories or have deep conversations. However, we sometimes focus our attention and energy more on these online relationships and neglect the real ones that we are having outside.</div> 

        <div class="smallspace">"In other words, civilization as of 1972 was projected to reach a total collapse by what is increasingly becoming our present day." (2) "Not everyone agreed with this approach." (4) - Interestingly enough, back in 1972 people were already aware of what the speed of development is going to harm the environment but they don't agree on a solution still until half a century later. This is because many big corporations that invent the latest and advanced technology are who profit the most from this capitalist system.</div>

    <h3>Week 10: Becca Abbe, The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement.</h3>
            
        <div class="smallspace">"In other words, civilization as of 1972 was projected to reach a total collapse by what is increasingly becoming our present day." (2) "Not everyone agreed with this approach." (4) - Interestingly enough, back in 1972 people were already aware of what the speed of development is going to harm the environment but they don't agree on a solution still until half a century later. This is because many big corporations that invent the latest and advanced technology are who profit the most from this capitalist system.</div>
        
        <div class="smallspace">In 1975, Japanese farmer and philosopher Masanobu Fukuoka published The One-Straw Revolution, a guide for natural, or “do-nothing,” farming. (10) I have no idea that other parts of the world are also in the same concern on this topic. Japan is a rather advanced country with a developed recycling system, which explains why Japan's current reputation in this matter.</div>
    
        <div class="smallspace">"Platforms like the WELL, and the World Wide Web to follow, pioneered a community-driven, decentralized media landscape in opposition to the unidirectional television, radio, and printed news outlets." (13) These new forms of communication indeed, to me is the most advance and useful form of communication. For example, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok have helped decentralized single-sided media since now everyone can make content and share opinions, and everyone can get famous and spread a new movement or ideology. As someone who came from a country where free speech is restricted, this is a great opportunity since people know better than what they were taught by the government and are more open-minded.</div>

        <div class="smallspace">"Yet in reality, life online is governed by the same limits to growth affecting the rest of our world. According to Low Tech Magazine the entire World Wide Web is responsible for consuming 10% of all global electricity production, a rate that is exponentially increasing." (14) - This is the most powerful quote so far of the text to me. Because indeed, I also fall into this trap without realizing it. The use of the internet is also one of the forms of burning electricity - resources. I was also blinded by this marketing idea of "Icloud" meaning somewhere up in the sky. Which can also lead to the same problem that we are trying to cure from decades ago.</div>
